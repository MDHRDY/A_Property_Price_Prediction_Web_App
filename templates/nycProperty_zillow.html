			Zillow reports the Zestimate predicts the price of a property in 
			New York City to within 20% of the actual market value 80.7% of the time

			When looking at the performance of individual boroughs however, the Zestimater 
			never performs quite as 
			well. Their most accurate NYC prediction is in Manhattan, where 
			the prediction is within 20% 
			of the actual market value 79.8% of the time (this is still quite good). Values from the chart below can be 
			found on Zillow's website <a href="http://www.zillow.com/howto/DataCoverageZestimateAccuracyNY.htm"  class="btn-link" role="button">here.</a></p>

					<p>Zillow has a total of 1.6 million listings in New York City, but 20%
					of these properties do not have Zestimates or the Zestimate has not been 
					reported because of poor performance (like Staten Island), and these absent predictions are not included in Zillow's 
			displayed accuracy calculations. If they were, the Zestimate would predict to within 20% 
			of the actual market value in New York City roughly 66% of the time.</p>
			
			<p>The total number of residential units in New York City is actually significantly larger than Zillow's total number of listings. 
			A 2014 study, <a href="http://www.nycrgb.org/downloads/research/pdf_reports/16HSR.pdf"  class="btn-link" role="button">referenced here</a>, 
			found in excess of 3.4 million properties. If we account for these and assume Zillow's stated accuracies to be valid, <b>the zestimate
			can predict to within 20% of the the actual market value for less than a third of the properties </b>in New York City. </p>
			
			<p>Though a disinterested observer might be forgiven for suspecting a certain selectivity in reporting, Zillow's predictions,
			for the fraction of properties with displayed Zestimates, are quite good. This sets a high barrier for entry, and perhaps that is why
			Zillow's Zestimate has no real competition. 
			</p>
			
			<p>One advantage of the model on this site is that it will currently give a prediction for any residential unit in New York City. 
			If the model's innaccurate
			predictions were removed - like Zillow's - the accuracy score would indeed go up!
