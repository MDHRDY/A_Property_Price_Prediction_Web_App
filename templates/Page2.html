If we further explore the set of properties that have appreciated by more than 50% over the last six years, a different 
picture emerges. While many of these homes have steadily appreciated in value (like the Upper West Side and Park Slope), 
others have rapidly appreciated in value over the last year. The figure below shows the subset of properties
from the previous dataset that have increased in value by more than 25% in the last year. Some of these properties are in 
neighborhoods (see the eastern side of Staten Island and the neighborhood between Sheepshead Bay and Midwood) where values have 
significantly decreased over the last six years (see the previous figure), suggesting that keen investors and homebuyers 
might be grabbing up undervalued properties.

Also of note are the neighborhoods of Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant, which also have seen a rapid increase in property valuations.</p>
