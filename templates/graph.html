<h3>
Despite the abundance of real estate information available on websites like Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com, 
tools for analyzing real estate market-trends are less sophisticated than other online tools, such as portfolio 
or stock trackers. Most real-estate websites highlight prevailing market conditions, but none assist investors 
or home buyers in comparing changes to one neighborhood against another over time. </h3>
<h3>
Below is dataset highlighting changes to property values in New York City. All datapoints represent 1- to 3-unit residential
properties. Homes that have increased in value by more than 50% over the last six years are shown in red, and homes that have
depreciated in value by more than 50% over the last six years are shown in blue.

If you are familiar with New York City, you might be unsurprised by how much values have appreciated in Manhattan (if we also 
considered Coops and Condos, most of the island would be covered in red). The extant of changes in Brooklyn, however, is more 
astonishing. While wealthy neighborhoods close to Manhattan, such as Brooklyn Heights, Carroll Gardens and Park Slope, have 
appreciated at rates similar to Greenwich Village or the Upper West Side, other Brooklyn haunts, far deeper into the borough's interior 
than most hipsters have ventured, have also appreciated significantly. These areas could offer attractive investment opportunities for those
that would prefer to avoid the buy-in price for Manhattan real estate.

 I haven't spent significant time in NYC for the last half decade, and from a cursory view of this data set, it's curious to see 
 how much waterfront property along Staten Island, Brooklyn and the Rockaways has suffered - presumably from Hurricane Sandy. If you're 
 in the market, I'd suggest (if the property insurance will cover the next big one) checking out the Rockaways before investors, 
 artists and hipsters capitalize on basement prices.
