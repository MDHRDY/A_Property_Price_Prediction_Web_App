Despite the abundance of real estate information available on websites like Zillow, 
Trulia, and Realtor.com, tools for analyzing real estate market-trends are less 
sophisticated than other online tools, such as portfolio or stock trackers. Most 
real-estate websites highlight prevailing market conditions, but none assist investors 
or home buyers in comparing changes to one neighborhood against another over time.</p>

Below is dataset highlighting changes to property values in New York City. All datapoints represent 1- to 3-unit residential
properties. Homes that have increased in value by more than 50% over the last six years are shown in red, and homes that have
depreciated in value by more than 50% over the last six years are shown in blue.</p>

Surprisingly, waterfront property has not been a winner over this period. Values for waterfront properties along Staten Island, 
Brooklyn, and the Rockaways have suffered - perhaps from Hurricane Sandy. For those who dream of both city living and seaside escape, these
areas may be worth a closer look.

<p>
One additional thought: why is it that some neighborhoods seem to have a mix of both highly appreciated and depreciated properties?
Getting a sense of what is happening on the Upper West Side (values are going up) and Rockaway Park (values are going down) is much simpler,
at first glance, compared to Staten Island, where values seem to be moving in both directions.
